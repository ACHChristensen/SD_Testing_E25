[- **Introduction to Unit Testing**, specifically:]: #
[  - Test Doubles]: #
[- **Unit Testing Best Practices and Anti-Patterns**]: #
[  - Best practices]: #
[    - Each test must verify only one behaviour]: #
[    - Test case selection should be comprehensive]: #
[    - Full regression testing should be run as often as possible]: #
[    - Code must be written so that it is testable (e.g., pure functions or methods)]: #
[  - Anti-patterns]: #
[    - Do never test private methods directly]: #
[    - Do never expose private state]: #
[    - Do not leak domain knowledge to the unit tests]: #
[    - Avoid code pollution]: #
