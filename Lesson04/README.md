# Lesson 4 - 16 September

[-> ]: #
[-> White Box slides -> show coverage in Pytest, Jest, PHPUnit]: #
[  -> Coverage exercises (maybe the 1st one as a whiteboard demo)]: #
[-> Static testing slides]: #
[  -> ESLint demo: npm init, npm init @eslint/config, copy-paste mjs config file, reload window]: #

[## Class takeaways]: #
[Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:]: #
[- **Test Design Techniques: White Box**, with a special focus on:]: #
[  - The value of coverage as a testing metric]: #
[  - The difference between statement and decision coverage]: #
[  - How to calculate coverage with different unit testing frameworks (slides on **Pytest**, **Jest**, **PHPUnit**)]: #
[- **Static Testing: Static Code Analysis**, specifically:]: #
[  - The value these tools bring to software quality]: #
[  - Linting, exemplified in JavaScript (check out the slides on **ESLint**)]: #
[  - Static code analysis tools like SonarQube]: #

[## Homework]: #
[- Reflect on all of the above]: #
[- Calculate coverage for your previous unit testing projects with your unit testing framework of choice]: #
[- Try linters for the programming language(s) of your choice with two purposes:]: #
[  - Finding syntax errors]: #
[  - Enforcing coding style and rules]: #
[- If into JavaScript, check out the ESLint configuration file sample(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/eslint_sample)]: #
[- Try as many static code analysis tools as you can. SonarQube is a good starting point, but you may find others specifically designed for your programming language(s) of choice]: #
