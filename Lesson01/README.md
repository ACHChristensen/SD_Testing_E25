## Homework
- Check out the following code samples:
  - Calculator Sum. Very basic unit tests mostly following the AAA pattern
  - VAT Calculation. Data provider/parameterised test examples. Jest's are a bit "playful"
  - Length Converter. Data providers and exception testing

- Research unit testing frameworks for your preferred programming language(s)

- Design and write unit tests for the following exercises using the programming language and unit testing framework of your choice. Try to elaborate a comprehensive list of test cases that bring value to the process:
  - Calculator
  - Roman Numerals
